# opn-watermark
A simple watermark that allows you to display the logo/image of your choice in-game on FiveM.  

The position is configurable as well as the image.

Choose images in 512X512 format even if other formats will work just as well.

You just have to replace opn-watermark\html/logo.png and adjust the style.css settings.
